# Cursor Rules for Mind Project

## Documentation Rules

### README.md
- Only update README.md to reflect the **current state** of the project
- Do NOT include planned features, future work, or "coming soon" sections
- Document only what actually exists and works right now
- If something is partially implemented, either omit it or clearly mark it as non-functional

## Development Guidelines

### Learning-Focused Development
- This is a learning project for web technologies
- Explain concepts before implementing them
- Make connections to C++ and Python when relevant
- Prefer clarity over brevity in code comments

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript strictly (no `any` types unless absolutely necessary)
- Prefer functional React components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use meaningful variable names

### File Organization
- Follow the structure defined in DEV_PLAN.md
- Create files only when explicitly requested or clearly needed
- Don't skip ahead in the development phases

## React/TypeScript Conventions
- Use arrow functions for components
- Use `interface` for props and data types
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use destructuring for props and state

## Testing
- Test manually in browser after each phase
- Verify hot reload is working
- Check browser console for errors before moving on
